# lua-docker [WIP]

A Docker Engine API wrapper for Lua

The module allows you to manage the Docker Engine of your choice
by writing Lua code.

When complete, it should be able to do just about anything
the `docker` command-line tool can.

Missing endpoints which are marked with a `@todo` tag
require a different request handling function and will
be done in the future.
